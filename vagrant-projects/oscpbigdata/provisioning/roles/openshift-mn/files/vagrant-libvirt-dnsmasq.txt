Notes for a properly DNS setup in Vagrant VM running
on top of libvirtd KVM host.

1. Create a /etc/hosts file an copy it in all VM hosts.
2. Setup a proper Bind DNS server in one of VMs (mn)
3. Modify the HOST dhsmasq to inject the step 2 DNS ip:

Note: The VMs must be stopped!!

sudo virsh
    net-list
    net-edit vagrant-libvirt
        ....
        <mac ....>
        <dns>
            <forwarder addr="192.168.121.218" /> ===> IP of MN with DNS Bind.
        </dns>
        ...
    net-destroy vagrant-libvirt
    net-start vagrant-libvirt
