# Persistent Elasticsearch Storage

# By default, the deployer creates an ephemeral deployment in which all of a
# podâ€™s data is lost upon restart. For production usage, specify a persistent
# storage volume for each Elasticsearch deployment configuration. You can create
# the necessary persistent volume claims before deploying or have them created
# for you. The PVCs must be named based on the es-pvc-prefix setting, which
# defaults to logging-es-; each PVC name will have a sequence number added to
# it, so logging-es-1, logging-es-2, and so on. If a PVC needed for the
# deployment exists already, it is used; if not, and es-pvc-size has been
# specified, it is created with a request for that size.

# in the master or mn remote client create the PV
