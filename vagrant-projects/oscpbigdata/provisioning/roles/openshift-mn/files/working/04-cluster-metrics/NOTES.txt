The final deployment is similar to this:


$ oc adm manage-node oscpbigdata-node1.redhat.lan --list-pods                                                                                                         

Listing matched pods on node: oscpbigdata-node1.redhat.lan

heapster-gmfdr               1/1       Running   1          17h  <==== Heapster


The Metrics compoentes are deployed in the region=infra nodes, as we setup in
the early steps.

Scaling OpenShift Container Platform Metrics Pods
-------------------------------------------------

One set of metrics pods (Cassandra/Hawkular/Heapster) is able to monitor at
least 10,000 pods. Pay attention to system load on nodes where OpenShift
Container Platform metrics pods run. Use that information to determine if it is
necessary to scale out a number of OpenShift Container Platform metrics pods
and spread the load across multiple OpenShift Container Platform nodes. Scaling
OpenShift Container Platform metrics "heapster pods" is not recommended.

- Scaling the Cassandra Components

If persistent storage was used to deploy OpenShift Container Platform metrics,
then you must create a persistent volume (PV) for the new Cassandra pod to use
before you can scale out the number of OpenShift Container Platform metrics
Cassandra pods. However, if Cassandra was deployed with dynamically provisioned
PVs, then this step is not necessary.

The Cassandra nodes use persistent storage, therefore scaling up or down is not
possible with replication controllers.

Scaling a Cassandra cluster requires you to use the hawkular-cassandra-node
template. By default, the Cassandra cluster is a single-node cluster.

To scale out the number of OpenShift Container Platform metrics hawkular pods
to two replicas, run:

# oc scale -n openshift-infra --replicas=2 rc hawkular-metrics

If you add a new node to a Cassandra cluster, the data stored in the cluster
rebalances across the cluster. The same thing happens If you remove a node from
the Cluster.

Note: OpenShift Container Platform version 3.3 does not provide Horizontal Pod
Autoscaling (HPA) support for metrics pods and scaling metrics pods.
