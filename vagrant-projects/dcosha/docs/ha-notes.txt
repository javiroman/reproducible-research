Note Important: The IP address of a node must not change after DC/OS is
installed on the node. For example, the IP address must not change when a node
is rebooted or if the DHCP lease is renewed. If the IP address of a node does
change, the node must be wiped and reinstalled.

Note: so the "static" backend is a new backend we added to exhibitor which
takes the master list which is statically provided at config time and just
writes it into the zookeeper.conf. Does that once, works with the assumption
the static master list never ever changes (and changing it will likely cause
inconsistent zookeeper badness for at least short windows, there is no
integrity / consistency checking).

The other zookeeper storage backends all use a "shared" storage place (NFS,
another zookeeper, s3 bucket, acs storage bucket, gce storage bucket).
Exhibitor on one host generates a zookeeper config, than "proposes" it to all
the other zookeepers by posting it to the shared storage location. When new
hosts want to add themselves to the cluster (a master is replaced), it will
grab the zookeeper.cfg out of the bucket, check which hosts are likely down,
and send out a new proposal. Iterate a couple of times until it's proposal is
accepted.

Note: DC/OS master IP (or qty) can not be changed after installation. You will
need to reinstall the cluster.  Now if you want to have "dynamice IPs" in 
the Masters you may want to use master_discovery: master_http_loadbalancer 
in your config.yaml

ZK Exhibitor: 

DCOS -> https://github.com/dcos/exhibitor
Netflix -> https://github.com/soabase/exhibitor/wiki

Each Exhibitor instance monitors the ZooKeeper server running on the same
server. If ZooKeeper is not running, Exhibitor will write the zoo.cfg file (see
Cluster-wide Configuration below) and start it. If ZooKeeper crashes for some
reason, Exhibitor will restart it.
