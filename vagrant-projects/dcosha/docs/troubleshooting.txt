1. Check the correct configuration of entry points of installer:

    - genconf/config.yaml: In particular master_list
    - genconf/ip_detect: In particular the interface for detection

2. It is recommended that you have forward and reverse lookups for FQDNs, short
   hostnames, and IP addresses. It is possible for DC/OS to function in
   environments without valid DNS support, but the following must work to support
   DC/OS services, including Spark:

    - "hostname -f" returns the FQDN
    - ""hostname -s" returns the short hostname

3. When troubleshooting problems with a DC/OS installation, you should explore
   the components in this sequence:

    a. Exhibitor
    b. Mesos master
    c. Mesos DNS
    d. DNS Forwarder (Spartan)
    e. DC/OS Marathon
    f. Jobs
    g. Admin Router

4. Checking NTP: Network Time Protocol (NTP) must be enabled on all nodes for
   clock synchronization. By default, during DC/OS startup you will receive an
   error if this is not enabled. You can check if NTP is enabled by running one of
   these commands, depending on your OS and configuration: ntptime, adjtimex -p, 
   or timedatectl.

5. Firewall: Ensure that firewalls and any other connection-filtering
   mechanisms are not interfering with cluster component communications. TCP, UDP,
   and ICMP must be permitted.

6. DNSmasq: Ensure that services that bind to port 53, which is required by DNS
   Forwarder (dcos-spartan.service), are disabled and stopped. For example:

   - sudo systemctl disable dnsmasq && sudo systemctl stop dnsmasq

a. Exhibitor
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Verify that Exhibitor is up and running at 
http://<MASTER_IP>:8181/exhibitor. If Exhibitor is not up and running:

- SSH to your master node and enter this command to check the Exhibitor
  service logs: "journalctl -flu dcos-exhibitor"

- Verify that /tmp is mounted without noexec. If it is mounted with noexec,
  Exhibitor will fail to bring up ZooKeeper because Java JNI won’t be able
  to exec a file it creates in /tmp and you will see multiple permission denied
  errors in the log. To repair /tmp mounted with noexec:

  mount -o remount,exec /tmp

- Check the output of /exhibitor/v1/cluster/status and verify that it shows
  the correct number of masters and that all of them are "serving" but only
  one of them is designated as "isLeader": true

curl -fsSL http://localhost:8181/exhibitor/v1/cluster/status | python -m json.tool

Note: Running this command in multi-master configurations can take up to
10-15 minutes to complete. If it doesn’t complete after 10-15 minutes, you
should carefully review the journalctl -flu dcos-exhibitor logs.
